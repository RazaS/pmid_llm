      "Many patients worldwide receive platelet components (PCs) through the transfusion of diverse types of blood components. PC transfusions are essential for the treatment of central thrombocytopenia of diverse causes, and such treatment is beneficial in patients at risk of severe bleeding. PC transfusions account for almost 10% of all the blood components supplied by blood services, but they are associated with about 3.25 times as many severe reactions (attributable to transfusion) than red blood cell transfusions after stringent in-process leukoreduction to less than 10<sup>6</sup> residual cells per blood component. PCs are not homogeneous, due to the considerable differences between donors. Furthermore, the modes of PC collection and preparation, the safety precautions taken to limit either the most common (allergic-type reactions and febrile non-hemolytic reactions) or the most severe (bacterial contamination, pulmonary lesions) adverse reactions, and storage and conservation methods can all result in so-called PC \"storage lesions\". Some storage lesions affect PC quality, with implications for patient outcome. Good transfusion practices should result in higher levels of platelet recovery and efficacy, and lower complication rates. These practices include a matching of tissue ABH antigens whenever possible, and of platelet HLA (and, to a lesser extent, HPA) antigens in immunization situations. This review provides an overview of all the available information relating to platelet transfusion, from donor and donation to bedside transfusion, and considers the impact of the measures applied to increase transfusion efficacy while improving safety and preventing transfusion inefficacy and refractoriness. It also considers alternatives to platelet component (PC) transfusion.\n",

      "Patients with β-thalassemia major (BTM) require regular blood transfusions, supported by appropriate iron chelation therapy (ICT), throughout their life. β-thalassemia is a global disease that is most highly prevalent in Southeast Asia, Africa, and Mediterranean countries. However, the global distribution of patients with β-thalassemia is changing due to population migration, and Northern European countries now have significant thalassemia populations. Globally, many patients with BTM have limited access to regular and safe blood transfusions. A lack of voluntary nonremunerated blood donors, poor awareness of thalassemia, a lack of national blood policies, and fragmented blood services contribute to a significant gap between the timely supply of, and demand for, safe blood. In many centers, there is inadequate provision of antigen testing, even for common red cell antigens such as CcEe and Kell. Policies to raise awareness and increase the use of red blood cell antigen testing and requesting of compatible blood in transfusion centers are needed to reduce alloimmunization (the development of antibodies to red blood cell antigens), which limits the effectiveness of transfusions and the potential availability of blood. Patients with BTM are also at risk of transfusion-transmitted infections unless appropriate blood screening and safety practices are in place. Hence, many patients are not transfused or are undertransfused, resulting in decreased health and quality-of-life outcomes. Hemovigilance, leukoreduction, and the ability to thoroughly investigate transfusion reactions are often lacking, especially in resource-poor countries. ICT is essential to prevent cardiac failure and other complications due to iron accumulation. Despite the availability of potentially inexpensive oral ICT, a high proportion of patients suffer complications of iron overload and die each year due to a lack of, or inadequate, ICT. Increased awareness, training, and resources are required to improve and standardize adequate blood transfusion services and ICT among the worldwide population of patients with BTM. ICT needs to be available, affordable, and correctly prescribed. Effective, safe, and affordable new treatments that reduce the blood transfusion burden in patients with β-thalassemia remain an unmet need.\n",

      "Blood and blood products are increasingly available for practitioners to use in the management of haematological conditions, and can be lifesaving and therapeutically useful for patients with anaemia and/or coagulopathies. It is important for feline healthcare that donors are selected appropriately, and transfusions of blood or blood products are given to recipients that will benefit from them. Complications can occur, but can be largely avoided with careful donor management and recipient selection, understanding of blood type compatibility, and transfusion monitoring.\n",

      "Preterm neonates with severe thrombocytopenia are frequently prescribed prophylactic platelet transfusions despite no evidence of benefit. Neonatal platelet transfusion practice varies, both nationally and internationally. Volumes and rates of transfusion in neonatology are based on historic precedent and lack an evidence base. The etiology of harm from platelet transfusions is poorly understood. Neonates are expected to be the longest surviving recipients of blood produce transfusions, and so avoiding transfusion associated harm is critical in this cohort. This article reviews the evidence for and against platelet transfusion in the neonate and identifies areas of future potential neonatal platelet transfusion research.\n",

      "Many previously widely accepted neonatal transfusion practices are changing as neonatologists become more aware of the risks to their patients of multiple blood product transfusions. Recent literature and research on neonatal transfusion practice are here reviewed, and practical guidelines and trigger thresholds for blood products commonly used in neonatal medicine are proposed.\n",

      "Transfusion of red blood cells, platelets, and fresh frozen plasma in neonatal patients has not been well characterized in the literature, with guidelines varying greatly between institutions. However, anemia and thrombocytopenia are highly prevalent, especially in preterm neonates. When transfusing a neonatal patient, clinicians must take into consideration physiologic differences, gestational and postnatal age, congenital disorders, and maternal factors while weighing the risks and benefits of transfusion. This review of existing literature summarizes current evidence-based neonatal transfusion guidelines and highlights areas of current ongoing research and those in need of future studies.\n",

      "Blood transfusion remains an important therapeutic intervention in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), aiming to both increase the oxygen carrying capacity of blood and to reduce the complications of vaso-occlusion. Simple, manual exchange and automated exchange can be effective in reducing the acute and chronic complications of SCD, and the advantages and disadvantages of each methodology mean they all have a role in different situations. Evidence for the role of emergency transfusion in the management of the acute complications of SCD, including acute pain and acute chest syndrome, comes from observational data. Several important randomized controlled trials have shown the efficacy of transfusion in primary and secondary stroke prevention in patients with SCD but, outside these areas, clinical practice lacks a clear evidence base. Evidence for the role of long-term transfusion in the prevention of the non-neurologic chronic complications of SCD comes from analysis of secondary outcomes of these randomized trials and from observational data. In view of the paucity of data, the risks and benefits of transfusion should be fully discussed with patients/families before a long-term transfusion program is commenced. Evidence is only available for the role of preoperative transfusion or for prophylactic transfusion through pregnancy in certain situations, and the role of transfusions outside these situations is discussed. Questions about when and how to transfuse in SCD remain and will need further randomized trials to provide answers.\n",
